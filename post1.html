                <p><b>Hey there!</b> Hope you found it somewhat intersting snooping around my page for a bit, I wouldn't imagine it taking long to read everything. It's not as if I've made many real-life accomplishments; and that statement really stood out when building this website.
                <p>I took a slight moment to think of what I could write down... for most of my life I rarely participated in competitions, sports, challenges or anything requiring hard-work that didn't suit my liking. I preferred to sit on my ass, play video-games and watch loads of media. I'm not saying thats "bad" or a "waste of time", I still to this day <i>really</i> enjoy doing both of those things - that's pretty obvious if you've seen my YouTube channel. However, constantly consuming absurd amounts can take quite a huge toll on mental state and I never had the maturity to break out of that addiction. Due to this problem, I risked my grades, I almost destroyed my entire social life especially during the rise of COVID and I also became worryingly overweight. Luckily, up until now, I FINALLY decided to take action.</p>
                <p>About a week ago since writing this I decided to pick up HTML, CSS and a sprinke of Javascript so that I could build a website for a relative of mine <i>(I will not be giving the link or details for privacy reasons.)</i> It wasn't easy at first though in the end it was absolutely worth it. Not only did I learn a lot within that period, for the first time in a very long while, I also felt truly proud of myself. It wasn't completely top-notch but according to feedback people said it was appealing enough. This project gave me the notion to build a website for myself. This was a way to put everything I learnt into use, discover more and to make a better reputation of myself.</p>
                <p>Although nowadays I can control myself much better, I can't get the thought out of my head that there are probably people out there whether being the same age or younger producing and achieving way more impressive feats than I've done throughout my entire life. I just wish so badly I could turn back the clock and make more of an effort.</p>
                <p>If you think you are unable to do something because "you aren't talaneted enough" or you "can't be bothered", you need to <i>snap</i> out of that mindset immediately. You might find it hard, you might think it's impossible, but you are incredibly capable. No matter how slow progress may be, it is a step in the right direction.</p>
                <p><b>It's better to start now than never.</b></p>
                <p>Thank you for reading.</p>
